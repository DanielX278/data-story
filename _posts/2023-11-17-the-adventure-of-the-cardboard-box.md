# IT'S JUST DRAFT DW

Over the centuries, humans proved themselves to be a social animal. 

On one hand, progress always led us to cooperate and form communities. On the other hand, we can hardly deal with loneliness: may it be for love, for friendship, or an innate competitive spirit, we would always find new ways to interact with each other.

In this innate competitive spirit, games found their quintessential opportunity to rise: may it be to enjoy a fun break or to achieve a prize we longed for, we love winning. We cannot stand a loss.

However, it's the same progress that we seek everyday that is now turning its back to us. Collectively, the brightest minds on our planets are turning what once was a great assistant into a fearsome rival: the computer.

## Timeline of human vs machines

If it's true that machines are our best friends when they help us in daily tasks, when help us predict diseases or protect our transactions through their countless computations, it is also true that they are becoming more and more able to counter our top-tier techniques and strategies.

Historically, we are not playing well:
- *1997, _DeepBlue and Garry Kasparov:_* the first computer to win a chess game against the world champion
- *2016, _AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol_* the first computer to win a Go game against the world champion
- *2017,* AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero are the first generalised algorithms without human data to achieve superhuman levels in chess, shogi and Go.

## What can we do?

It's hard to say whether this is the right direction or not, should we just give up?

We hope not, and this is why we're planning a new study. What all the games mentioned above have in common is an algorithmic game design: no matter the culture or prior knowledge of the players, the ultimate scope would always be to find the best move or counter move for a specific move.

These games miss a human touch, and for this reason we're planning a new challenge: _Wikispeedia_.

In a game where the agents aim to minimize the number of nodes to reach a target from their starting point, we expect the human ability to play with semantics and general knowledge to be a key factor in the game design.

Can the machine mimic our humanity, and find its way through the game?
