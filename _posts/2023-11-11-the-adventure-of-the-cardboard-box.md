# IT'S JUST DRAFT DW

Over the centuries, humans proved themselves to be a social animal. On one hand, progress always led us to cooperate and form communities. On the other hand, we can hardly deal with loneliness: may it be for love, for friendship, or an innate competitive spirit, we would always find new ways to interact with each other.

In this innate competitive spirit, games found their quintessential opportunity to rise: may it be to enjoy a fun break or to achieve a prize we longed for, we love winning. We cannot stand a loss.

However, it's the same progress that we seek everyday that is now turning its back to us. Collectively, the brightest minds on our planets are turning what once was a great assistant into a fearsome rival: the computer.


## What is going on?

- humans are nice and love to play
- humans are competitive by nature
- humans created computers as assistants and now they're battling against them

## Timeline of human vs machines

If it's true that machines are our best friends when they help us in daily tasks, when help us predict diseases or protect our transactions through their countless computations, it is also true that they are becoming more and more able to counter our top-tier techniques and strategies.

Historically, we are not playing well:
- *1997, _DeepBlue and Garry Kasparov:_* the first computer to win a chess game against the world champion
- *2016, _AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol_* the first computer to win a Go game against the world champion
- *2017,* AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero are the first generalised algorithms without human data to achieve superhuman levels in chess, shogi and Go.

## Can we describe and predict what will happen?
