When AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol in 2016, this caused a shake up in the AI world \[1\]. For years, the idea
of having an AI beat a human in Go was deemed impossible, but advancements in the field allowed this impossible dream to
become a reality.

Having AI compete against humans has been a core part of AI research since the dawn of computers themselves. Alan Turing
himself worked on the first chess engine \[2\], and the victory of Deep Blue over Garry Kasparov marked a change
in the way we see computers. They are as good, or even better, than our best \[3\].

Now, we will put AI to the test in a different game: Wikispeedia (also known as The Wikipedia Game) \[4\].
