When AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol in 2016, this caused a shake up in the AI world <sup>1</sup>. For years, the idea
of having an AI beat a human in Go was deemed impossible, but advancements in the field allowed this impossible dream to
become a reality.

Having AI compete against humans has been a core part of AI research since the dawn of computers themselves. Alan Turing
himself worked on the first chess engine <sup>2</sup>, and the victory of Deep Blue over Garry Kasparov marked a change
in the way we see computers. They are as good, or even better, than our best <sup>3</sup>.

Now, we will put AI to the test in a different game: Wikispeedia (also known as The Wikipedia Game) <sup>4</sup>.
